This repository backs a technical archive and learning log focused on
preserving and rebuilding projects across multiple generations of tools
and frameworks.

---

## What This Is

- A documentation-first archive, not a portfolio
- A place for XNA-era projects preserved for reference
- A collection of rebuilt or reimplemented projects using modern tooling
- Concrete, working examples over abstract tutorials

---

## Sections

### XNA Projects
Legacy projects originating from the XNA 4.0 era, kept for historical and
technical reference.

### Rebuilds
Projects that have been heavily modified or fully rebuilt using modern
runtimes and development environments (e.g. Visual Studio 2022, MonoGame
and engine-agnostic tooling).

---

## Status

Content is added and revised over time. Not all archived projects are
actively maintained or retested.
